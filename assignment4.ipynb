    "Forward propagation in a neural network serves the purpose of computing the output of the network given a set of input data. It involves passing the input data through the network's layers of neurons, where each neuron performs a weighted sum of its inputs followed by the application of an activation function. This process continues through the hidden layers until the final output layer produces the network's prediction or output.\n",

    "Prediction: Forward propagation allows the neural network to make predictions or classifications on input data. By propagating the input data through the network, it produces an output that represents the network's prediction for the given input.\n",
